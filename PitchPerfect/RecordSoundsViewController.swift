class RecordSoundsViewController: UIViewController, AVAudioRecorderDelegate {
    //the above line means, the class RecordSoundsViewController is inherited from a super class UIViewController. In swift, only one superclass can be inherited. But a class can conform to many protocol classes. In this case, it conforms to the AVAudioRecorderDelegate. Which means, the RecordSoundsViewController acts as a delegate of AvAudioRecorder. Once the recording task is finished by the AVAudioRecorder, it informs the RecordSoundsViewController about it. Hence, AVAudioRecorder acts just as a tool to record videos. And thereby, both the classes here are loosely coupled and yet can communicate with each other wihtout knowing each other's details.
